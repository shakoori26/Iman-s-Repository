        <h1>Popular Programming Languages</h1>
        <p>Two kinds of programming languages are <em>compiled</em> and <em>scripting</em>. compiled
        language code is first processed by a compiler, which produces an executable for you to run. 
        Scripting language code is still compiled first, but it is compiled "on the fly" and is
        immediately run for you.
