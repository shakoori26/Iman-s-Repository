     <h1>Introduction</h1>   
     <p>My favorite animal is a dog for many reasons. They are loving, kind, and so cute. Their playful
        nature can always cheer me up when I'm feeling down. Dogs are always there for you, like a best
        friend. They always want to play, snuggle, and have fun. Dogs are like a human's best friend.</p>
    <h2>Sense of Smell</h2>
     <p>Dogs have a sense of smell that's around 10,000 to 100,000 times better than humans. this
        allows them to detect smells with great accuracy that humans don't have. This makes them 
        exceptional at hunting, tracking, search and rescue,etc.</p>
    <h3>Hearing</h3> 
     <p>Dogs have exceptional hearing abilities. They can hear frequencies about twice as high as 
        humans can, allowing them to hear things that humans cannot. This sense of hearing makes them 
        really good at picking up subtle sounds, like jingling keys and footsteps.</p>
