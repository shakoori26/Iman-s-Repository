<p> Summer break is a time to relax and recharge after a long and busy<br/>
    summer. During my summer break, I will mostly be hanging out with my<br/>
    family and friends. I am also going on vacation to the East Coast with<br/>
    my family. I will also spend a lot of time outside, enjoying the nice<br/>
    weather, by swimming and tanning. I hope to go Up North to the beach<br/>
    sometime this summer</p>
